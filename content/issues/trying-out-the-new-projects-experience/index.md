Educational problems of Larkana
In the Larkana city, there are several historic and new schools, colleges, and universities for both boys and girls. Many of these institutions are both private and public. IBA has taken over Public School, and Agha Khan University Education Board will take over Sindh Board starting in 2020.
There are some of the Government Pilot School, Larkana (established in 1926 by British colonists), Girls High School, Public School Larkana, Deeni Madersa High School, and Government Degree College are among the local educational institutions. Polytechnic Institute and Teachers' Training College are examples of technical institutes. The standard of education frequently corresponds to a state's economic prosperity. For the growth of a nation, education is a common criterion. Pakistan's extreme poverty necessitates immediate action by both the governmental and private sectors to improve education standards.
If the present methods for preventing dropout practices are not rebuilt, every effort in this area will be ineffective and unproductive. Because of the decline in educational quality, our testing system has produced frustration among students. As a result, the national education system requires a modernization of the examination system.
Problems facing education in Larkana
•	Interference by Politicians in Schools
The majority of participants agreed that public educational institutions in Sindh are largely controlled by political and bureaucratic interests. Due to heavy political involvement, teachers are not selected on merit. Furthermore, there is no teacher leadership in the classroom.
•	Unfavorable Economic Conditions
It is a matter of fact that there is bad economic circumstances which is the cause of student dropout, particularly in rural regions of Larkana, since parents, who were economically destitute, sent their children to work in shops or fields to help them earn money.
•	Inadequate supply of facilities
The majority of people in Larkana agreed that low teacher motivation contributes to student dropout in Larkana's primary schools, which is also due to limited supply of the teaching facilities. As shown below, the students are forced to be taught while seated on the ground, due to inadequate classrooms.
 
•	High levels of Illiteracy
Vast majority of participants in the Larkana city claims that dropping out is a severe problem. Illiteracy is one of the leading causes of student dropout, so it's a cause for concern.
•	High levels of Poverty
The majority of those polled said that poverty has a direct impact on the rising number of primary school dropouts in Larkana. As shown in the pictures below:
  
•	Outbreak of tribal Wars in the Neighborhood
The majority of people claim that feudalism was one of the primary characteristics in Sindhi society that contributed to the educational sector's lack of development. That is why feudalists always try to push the poor back and incite tribes to fight over minor social concerns.
•	  Children labor
Child labor is one of the main causes of rising dropout rates in Larkana, according to the majority of participants. Students are unable to carry out academic activities due to rising poverty and financial hardship. This is why the majority of students fail to complete their education.
•	Inadequate Knowledge
Most parents prefer Madarsa education to school education, according to the majority of participants. Instead of general education, parents want their children to learn religious education.
Solutions to the Problems facing education in Larkana
•	Improvement of internal and external oversight in education 
Students will be required to study the most up-to-date IT skills and to experiment with sophisticated techniques using online learning modules. Teachers and schools play a role in both internal and external management in this situation.
•	Teachers need to be taught new skills.
Teachers must be trained and exposed to new abilities so that they can properly handle and use information technology in schools, which is a solution to Pakistan's education difficulties.
•	Clear allocation of estimated budgets
Provinces frequently express dissatisfaction with the budget allotted to education in their provinces. Whatever the case may be, each region is entitled to a fair share of educational development programs.
•	Improvement of the grading system in Pakistan
When we talk about education difficulties in Pakistan and how to solve them, another key issue is the passing method for current exams. Almost every student is desperate to pass the exam. The entire focus and energy is directed into achieving passing or excellent grades.

Recommendations to ways of solving problems facing education system in Larkana
•	Primary and secondary education should be free and compulsory.
•	The state must ensure that children are taught an up-to-date curriculum using innovative teaching methods.
•	The educational system needs to be diverted away from rote learning and toward knowledge and research-based initiatives. As a result, the system should encourage cohesion.
•	In the educational system, accountability should be implemented. To account for where the funds have been spent, proper and trustworthy procedures should be implemented. 
•	It may take some time, but the government should gradually get the entire country onto a consistent education system. Inequality would be reduced if the public and private sectors provided the same education. 
•	To deliver education to rural areas, the government should collaborate with non-governmental organizations.
•	Because it develops skills, technical education should be considered a required aspect of school.
•	Carpentry, electrical, and other courses should be incorporated in the curriculum.
•	To reduce the dropout rate, parents may be offered financial incentives to send their children to school.
To conclude, it is a matter of fact that education determines whether or not a country succeeds. The nation's wealth is its people. The illiterate masses will only be a liability for the government. Political meddling, weak curriculum, gender gaps, a lack of accountability, incompetent teaching staff, and a rote learning method afflict Pakistan's education system. Pakistan must undergo extensive administrative reforms. Strong leadership, an adequate political context, acknowledgment of cultural and social components in education, and the presence of an attitude toward change are all essential factors for a strong administration to reign in the wayward parts of Pakistan's education system.
Health problems of Larkana
About Pakistan's 60 million poor people are the poorest in the world. Many citizens are unable to meet even their most basic necessities due to a lack of resources. Furthermore, if they are diagnosed with a disease, they have no one to turn to. In Pakistan, the number of local hospitals, doctors, and nurses is insufficient to address the requirements of the underprivileged.
Local hospitals have been treating poor people for free, but they are unable to treat a huge number of patients at once due to a lack of resources. Furthermore, patients who require surgical treatment at a local hospital must wait a long time due to the waiting list. When it's their turn, the patient has passed away or their condition has deteriorated.
•	Malaria 
Malaria is one of Pakistan's most serious public health issues. It affects the vast majority of slum dwellers. Mosquitoes that breed in unclean water and unsanitary settings, which are common in rural regions, spread the disease.
•	Cancer
Cancer is another dreadful disease that is a prominent cause of death in Pakistan. The two most frequent types of cancer in Pakistan are lung and breast cancer.
 
•	Heart disease
One of the most common causes of death in Pakistan is ischemic heart disease. Pollution, a poor diet, tainted water, and smoking are all contributing causes.
•	Hiv/aids 
In Pakistan, drug addicts use tainted syringes to spread the disease. As the number of persons living with HIV in Pakistan rises at an alarming rate, the government must take aggressive actions to prevent the disease.
 
•	Maternal and child health problems
Mother and child health is a serious problem that is more widespread in rural areas than in cities. Women in rural areas face insufficient nutrition, awareness, and care during their pregnancy, resulting in poor baby health.
•	Mental health problem
It is one of the most serious health issues in Pakistan. Mental disease affects more than 60 million Pakistanis. Only a few cases have been reported, however they are not properly treated due to Pakistan's lack of comprehensive mental health care facilities.
 
Solutions to health problems
•	Increased tobacco and alcohol taxation- Increasing tobacco and alcohol taxes to encourage people to use less is one way to address public health issues.
•	Enhance the quality of life
Everyone who is suffering from a serious illness should seek medical help. Governments must ensure that hospitals have the financial and human resources to treat as many people as feasible.
•	Improving research could lead to the cure of many currently incurable diseases.
•	Others must be educated and persuaded
Your participation is critical in addressing public health challenges. However, boosting health awareness and encouraging others can have a greater influence because our positive effects will be compounded. As a result, educate your family and friends about public health challenges and how they can contribute to their resolution. You can also learn about health-related measures to take.
•	Consumption decreases
Increased greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global warming as a result of products creation and disposal. Furthermore, global warming is a major contributor to public health concerns. As a result, to mitigate the negative effects of global warming, we must cut our consumption.
•	Recycling and reusing our household items are another way we may help to alleviate public health risks.
•	Educate and promote vaccinations- By teaching and promoting vaccines, more individuals will be willing to receive them, reducing the risk of negative public health consequences.
Recommendations
•	I would recommend the government to enforce strict rules and regulations concerning the use of tobacco.
•	The state must ensure that people are taught the health problems and their preventive measures. 
•	It may take some time, but the government should gradually get the entire country onto a consistent education system. 
•	People should be taught that the best means is abstinence from sexual intercourse until marriage.
•	Government should establish education centers for public health education.
Conclusion 
Environmental issues involving public health are a critical issue. Many factors contribute to public health issues that can be influenced by our daily actions. Lowering your alcohol or tobacco intake, for example, would be a starting step toward reducing negative consequences on your own health. Additionally, you can take a number of steps to alleviate the worldwide public health issue, such as reducing personal intake. We can have a major impact on the public health crisis if everyone makes a tiny contribution.
